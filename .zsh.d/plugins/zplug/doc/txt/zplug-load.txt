NAME
----
zplug-load - Source installed plugins and add installed commands to `$PATH`


SYNOPSIS
--------

    The word 'package' refers to the string in the format: "username/reponame".


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Be able to use a package that has been installed on the current shell.


OPTIONS
-------
*--verbose*::
    Be verbose.


EXAMPLES
--------

Installation check:

------------
$ zplug load
------------


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
'ZPLUG_LOADFILE'::
    Defaults to `$ZPLUG_HOME/packages.zsh`.
    This file is used to add packages from zplug on the command-line. This is a
    useful feature when you want to isolate your zplug configurations from your
    `.zshrc`. Note that you don't need to add packages from the command line to
    use this feature: you can manually edit this file, and it'll work just
    fine!

'ZPLUG_USE_CACHE'::
    Defaults to `true`.
    If this variable is true, zplug uses a cache file to speed up the loading process.
    The cache file is located at `$ZPLUG_CACHE_DIR` (`$ZPLUG_HOME/.cache` by default).
    If you want to clear the cache, please run `zplug clear` or do the following:

------------
$ ZPLUG_USE_CACHE=false zplug load
------------

'ZPLUG_CACHE_DIR'::
    Defaults to `$ZPLUG_HOME/.cache`.
    Specifies where to save the cache. For example, you can set this to
    `$HOME/.cache/zplug/cache` to follow XDG Base Directory Specification

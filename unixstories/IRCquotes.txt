(grawity) hmm, doesn't glibc have a clone() nowadays
(thestinger) grawity: yes, but it's messed up
(demize) Messed up in what way?
(thestinger) demize: it takes a callback function (even though clone works like fork), forces you to pass a child stack, etc.
(thestinger) so screw glibc
(demize) ah..
(demize) better just fork yourself then...
(thestinger) well, better just clone yourself ;]
(thestinger) http://cgit.freedesktop.org/systemd/systemd/tree/src/nspawn/nspawn.c?id=05947befcec9afb83b9ce48d613ff372c63e2ed1#n1394
(thestinger) https://github.com/thestinger/playpen/blob/master/playpen.c#L337
(thestinger) I'm sure if you look in any other container software it's the same
(demize) heh
(thestinger) you can also use unshare(), but thanks to glibc entering the process namespace before fork wasn't allowed
(thestinger) so you can unshare CLONE_NEWPID but it doesn't get unshared until fork/clone
(thestinger) why?
(thestinger) because glibc caches getpid()
(thestinger) because there was some system call benchmark using getpid
(thestinger) and they wanted to win

<Khiriena> Hypothetical:  The tribes of Apeshit and Batshit are in a religious war over holy ground.  During the day, Apeshit sends one person -more than that is considered sacrilege- over to their shrine, at the end of the holy ground farthest from their village.
<Khiriena> This is impeded by the efforts of the Batshit tribe, who, as their "war tactic", during the nights, when the Apeshit tribe members are asleep, construct a maze of sorts.  They aren't very creative however, so the maze only ever has one correct path.
<Khiriena> That is, the maze has three sections where one is to choose from two pathways.  The wrong paths lead to dead ends, sometimes with literal death at the hands of the Batshit tribe members.  Which paths are wrong changes every night, since the Batshit tribe members rebuild the maze each time.  It is, however, consistently too large to be navigated around.
<Khiriena> Thus, assuming the Apeshit tribe members want to send someone to provide offerings to their shrine, and the offering bringer is guaranteed to survive if the correct paths are chosen in the maze, what are the odds the offering bringer will reach the shrine?
<Khiriena> In simpler terms, I guess....  The correct one of two paths must be chosen three times in succession to get through the maze.  What are the odds of succeeding?
<DewdropMaple> That's a one-in-eight chance of success.
<DewdropMaple> Exactly one valid path out of 2^3 possible paths, so 1/8.
<Khiriena> Ah yes.  Thanks & sorry, for both my stupidity, and my stupid "story".

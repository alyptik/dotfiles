Read the following documents to learn how to use them.  \n\n- [Advanced Topic Tutorial](https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus/wiki/AdvancedTopicTutorial)\n- [Occurrence Modifier](https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus/wiki/OccurrenceModifier)\n- [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n# Important\n\n- **vim-mode-plus is replacement for vim-mode, you must disable vim-mode first to use vim-mode-plus**.\n- You don't need the following packages since they're built-in to vim-mode-plus:\n  - [vim-surround](https://atom.io/packages/vim-surround): No default keymap. See FAQ section in this doc.\n  - [vim-mode-visual-block](https://atom.io/packages/vim-mode-visual-block)\n- Scope for CSS selector and keymap is different from vim-mode, **not compatible**.\n- Internal code base is very different. Thus, issues and PRs should be directly sent to vim-mode-plus. **DON'T report vim-mode-plus's issues or PRs to the official vim-mode.**\n\n# Thanks\n\nMy work is greatly owing to former achievements of the original vim-mode developers and many of its contributors.  \nAs you can see in the commit history, this project was originally started by forking official [vim-mode](https://github.com/atom/vim-mode).  \nThe great design to achieve Vim operation by composing operator with target (motion, text-object) on top of operationStack still lives in vim-mode-plus now.  \nI don't think I can find this idea by myself from nothing.  \nSincerely, I feel I couldn't do anything without the original vim-mode.  \n\n# Issue report\n\n- Read [ISSUE_TEMPLATE](https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus/blob/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)\n\n# Whats this?\n\nFork of [vim-mode](https://github.com/atom/vim-mode). Started on 2015.8.1.\n\n- Many bug fixes.\n- Refactoring: Rewritten almost every line of code.\n- Highlight search\n- visual-blockwise built-in\n- Incremental search by `incrementalSearch` setting (disabled by default).\n- Cursor visible in all visual-mode (characterwise, blockwise, linewise).\n- Maintain the same cursor position after operations (e.g `y`, `gU`) by `stayOnYank`, `stayOnOperate` setting. (disabled by default)\n- Lots of new motions like `move-up-to-edge`, `move-down-to-edge`. (Mapped to `[` and `]`, Aggressive decision.)\n- Surround built-in. Powerful AnyPair family (`change-surround-any-pair` operator, `inner-any-pair` text-object) to detect pair automatically.\n- Set cursor position to start of change on undo or redo by enabling `setCursorToStartOfChangeOnUndoRedo` (enabled by default. Atom's default is end of change).\n- Allow super granular keymap which is only effective when specific operation is pending like `yank-pending`, `delete-pending`. [#215](https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus/issues/215)\n- And more...\n\n# FAQ\n\nSearch [Q&A](https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3AQ%26A) label on issues.\n\n### Why fork? why not directly contribute to official vim-mode?\n\n- Changes are [too big](https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus/graphs/contributors).\n- I felt many features are too experimental to merge to the official vim-mode.\n\n### In visual-block mode, some motions make the editor slow, freeze.\n\nNot freezing, it's just VERY slow.  \nYou can workaround by disabling some keymap. See [#214](https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus/issues/214).\n\n### ex-mode?\n\n- The [ex-mode](https://atom.io/packages/ex-mode) package has the most complete ex-mode support.\n- Very immature package [vim-mode-plus-ex-mode](https://atom.io/packages/vim-mode-plus-ex-mode) exists.\n- My thought for ex-mode is [here #52](https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus/issues/52).\n\n### Want to suppress autocomplete-plus's auto suggestion except insert-mode.\n\nSet `suppressActivationForEditorClasses` autocomplete-plus's config to following value.\n\n```\nvim-mode-plus.normal-mode, vim-mode-plus.visual-mode, vim-mode-plus.operator-pending-mode, vim-mode-plus.insert-mode.replace\n```\n\nIf you want to directly edit `config.cson`, here it is.\n\n```coffeescript\n\"autocomplete-plus\":\n  suppressActivationForEditorClasses: [\n    \"vim-mode-plus.normal-mode\"\n    \"vim-mode-plus.visual-mode\"\n    \"vim-mode-plus.operator-pending-mode\"\n    \"vim-mode-plus.insert-mode.replace\"\n  ]\n```\n\n### Surround not work\n\nNo default keymaps are provided.\nIf you want, install [vim-mode-plus-keymaps-for-surround](https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus-keymaps-for-surround)\n\n### How can I insert single white space when surround?\n\nSet `Characters To Add Space On Surround`. from vim-mode-plus's setting.\n\n# Wiki\n\n- [Home](https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus/wiki/Home)\n\n# Keymap\n\nvim-mode-plus has many advanced, experimental features but most of them have no default keymap.  \nIf you want to use the full power of vim-mode-plus, see and experiment with each keymap, command in following links.  \n\n- [Commands](https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus/wiki/Commands) summary of vmp's commands with keymap.\n- [default keymaps](https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus/blob/master/keymaps/vim-mode-plus.cson)\n- [my dotfiles](https://github.com/t9md/dotfiles)\n\n# Helper packages\n\n- [ListOfVimModePlusPlugins](https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus/wiki/ListOfVimModePlusPlugins)\n\nBelow is list of my packages which provide more vim-like experience.  \nWhy I don't build in these features? Because it takes more time and some features are useful for non-vim user.\n\n- [cursor-history](https://atom.io/packages/cursor-history)\nprovides <kbd>c-i</kbd>, <kbd>c-o</kbd> to go/back in the cursor position history.\n- [open-this](https://atom.io/packages/open-this)\nprovides <kbd>gf</kbd> to open file under cursor.\n- [clip-history](https://atom.io/packages/clip-history)\nDoes not exist in pure Vim, provides clip-board history you can pop yanked text until you get result you want.\n- [choose-pane](https://atom.io/packages/choose-pane)\nDoes not exist in pure Vim, provides keyboard navigation between panes/panels by choosing it by label.\n- [paner](https://atom.io/packages/paner)\nprovides <kbd>ctrl-w H, J, K, L, x</kbd> to move pane.\n\n# References\n\n## Vim official\n- [motion](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/motion.txt.html)\n- [operator](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/motion.txt.html#operator)\n- [text-object](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/motion.txt.html#object-select)\n- [change](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/change.txt.html)\n- [marks](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/motion.txt.html#mark-motions)\n- [scroll](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/scroll.txt.html)\n- [search-commands](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/pattern.txt.html#search-commands)\n\n## Other\n- [operator, the true power of Vim](http://whileimautomaton.net/2008/11/vimm3/operator) by kana.  \n  True power of Vim is Operator and TextOjbect.\n\n- [List of text-object as vim plugin](https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-user/wiki)  \n  vim-mode-plus builtin textobj for function, fold, entire, comment, indent, line, and any-pair(super set of many pair text-obj)\n\n# Commit emoji convention\n\n- :memo: Add comment or doc\n- :gift: New feature.\n- :bug: Bug fix\n- :bomb: Breaking compatibility.\n- :white_check_mark: Write test.\n- :fire: Remove something.\n- :beer: I'm happy like reduced code complexity.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus#readme","_id":"vim-mode-plus@0.93.0","_shasum":"e36af107c7f5da24f7fb74fc03c48e99e23485eb","_resolved":"file:../d-11752-1999-ull5w9.pf4j9k9/package.tgz","_from":"../d-11752-1999-ull5w9.pf4j9k9/package.tgz"}

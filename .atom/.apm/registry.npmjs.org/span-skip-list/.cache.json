Say you have a table entries like the following:\n\n| x | y |\n|---|---|\n| 3 | 3 |\n| 5 | 2 |\n| 2 | 7 |\n| 4 | 4 |\n\nWith this data structure, you can determine how many y's you have traversed when\nyou've traversed up to a certain number of x's. For example, when you've\ntraversed up to 8 in the x dimension your total in the y dimension is 5. Here's\nan example of how you'd use the span skip list to answer that query:\n\n```coffeescript\nSpanSkipList = require 'span-skip-list'\n\n# Construct with the dimensions you want to track\nlist = new SpanSkipList('x', 'y')\n\n# Populate with entries. Splice takes the dimension in which to interpret the\n# index as a first argument. More on that later.\nentries = [\n  {x: 3, y: 3}\n  {x: 5, y: 2}\n  {x: 2, y: 7}\n  {x: 4, y: 4}\n]\nlist.splice('x', 0, 0, entries...)\nlist.getElements() # => [{x: 3, y: 3} {x: 5, y: 2} {x: 2, y: 7} {x: 4, y: 4}]\n\n# Call ::totalTo with a total in one dimension to get a total in all dimensions\n# up to the element that exceeds the target value in that dimension.\nlist.totalTo(8, 'x') # => { x: 8, y: 5 }\nlist.totalTo(10, 'x') # => { x: 10, y: 12 }\n\n# Note that you always get the total exclusive of the exceeding element. In this\n# case, x = 11 returns the same total as x = 10 because including the next\n# element ({x: 4, y: 4} would make x = 14, which exceeds x = 11.\nlist.totalTo(11, 'x') # => { x: 10, y: 12 }\n\n# The splice occurs at the index of the first element that exceeds the given\n# index in the given dimension. In this case, the splice at x = 3 replaces the\n# element {x: 5, y: 2} with the given element. The ::splice method returns an\n# array of removed elements, list like Array::splice.\nlist.splice('x', 3, 1, {x: 7, y: 1}) # => [{x: 5, y: 2}]\nlist.getElements() # => [{x: 3, y: 3}, {x: 7, y: 1}, {x: 2, y: 7}, {x: 4, y: 4}]\n\n# You can splice in any tracked dimension:\nlist.splice('y', 4, 0, {x: 2, y: 2})\nlist.getElements() # => [{x: 3, y: 3}, {x: 7, y: 1}, {x: 2, y: 2}, {x: 2, y: 7}, {x: 4, y: 4}]\n\n# You can also splice and run totals in the special 'elements' dimension, which\n# counts each element as a unit. This returns the total of the first 3 elements:\nlist.totalTo(3, 'elements') # => {x: 12, y: 6}\n\n# And this splices at the given element index:\nlist.splice('elements', 2, 1) # => [{x: 2, y: 2}]\nlist.getElements() # => [{x: 3, y: 3}, {x: 7, y: 1}, {x: 2, y: 7}, {x: 4, y: 4}]\n```\n","maintainers":[{"email":"atom@github.com","name":"atom-team"},{"email":"kevinsawicki@gmail.com","name":"kevinsawicki"},{"email":"nathan@github.com","name":"nathansobo"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-05-22T16:35:49.482Z","created":"2013-08-30T17:57:32.023Z","0.1.0":"2013-08-30T17:57:37.127Z","0.1.1":"2013-08-30T18:09:16.987Z","0.2.0":"2015-02-13T00:13:02.924Z"},"author":{"name":"Nathan Sobo"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/atom/span-skip-list.git"},"keywords":["skip-list","data-structure","index"],"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/atom/span-skip-list/issues"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","homepage":"http://atom.github.io/span-skip-list","_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"59231365-1873\"","_lastModified":"Mon, 22 May 2017 16:35:49 GMT"}

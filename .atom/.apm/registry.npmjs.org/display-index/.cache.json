This index is used to efficiently traverse this mapping in order to translate positions.\n\n## DisplayIndex\n\n### `splice (startRow, replacedCount, newScreenLines)`\n\nUse this method to add to the index. Like `Array.prototype.splice`, it takes a start row and the number of rows you want to replace. The third arguments is an array of *screen lines*, which are objects that represent the spatial footprint of a single line on screen.\n\nEach screen line has the following properties:\n\n* `screenExtent` The length of the line on screen.\n* `bufferExtent` The traversal distance to the start of the next screen line in the buffer.\n* `tokens` An array of token objects, each with its own `screenExtent` and `bufferExtent` properties as well as an optional `metadata` property. Each token represents a certain number of columns on screen that spans a certain number of rows and columns in the buffer.\n* `softWrappedAtStart` A boolean indicating whether this line continues from a previous line that ends in a soft line break.\n* `softWrappedAtEnd` A boolean indicating whether this line ends with a soft line-break.\n\nHere is an example of splicing into the display index:\n\n```js\ndisplayIndex.splice(0, 0, [\n  {\n    screenExtent: 11,\n    bufferExtent: point(3, 0),\n    tokens: [\n      {screenExtent: 5, bufferExtent: point(0, 5), metadata: 'a'},\n      // this token is a fold. it spans 1 column on screen but\n      // spans 2 rows, 5 columns in the buffer.\n      {screenExtent: 1, bufferExtent: point(2, 5), metadata: 'b'},\n      {screenExtent: 5, bufferExtent: point(0, 5), metadata: 'c'}\n    ],\n    softWrappedAtStart: false,\n    softWrappedAtEnd: false\n  },\n  {\n    screenExtent: 10,\n    // This line is soft-wrapped, so it has a buffer extent\n    // of 0 rows, 10 columns.\n    bufferExtent: point(0, 10),\n    tokens: [\n      {screenExtent: 5, bufferExtent: point(0, 5), metadata: 'd'},\n      {screenExtent: 5, bufferExtent: point(0, 5), metadata: 'e'}\n    ],\n    softWrappedAtStart: false,\n    softWrappedAtEnd: true\n  },\n  {\n    screenExtent: 15,\n    // This is the last line, so it also only extends 10 columns.\n    bufferExtent: point(0, 10),\n    tokens: [\n      // This token expressed a \"hanging indent\", injecting 5 columns\n      // on screen but consuming no space in the buffer.\n      {screenExtent: 5, bufferExtent: point(0, 0), metadata: 'f'},\n      {screenExtent: 5, bufferExtent: point(0, 5), metadata: 'g'},\n      {screenExtent: 5, bufferExtent: point(0, 5), metadata: 'h'}\n    ],\n    softWrappedAtStart: true,\n    softWrappedAtEnd: false\n  }\n])\n```\n\nAs you can see above, the structure of the screen lines determines the shape of the mapping between buffer and screen, which this data structure indexes.\n\n### `buildScreenLineIterator ()`\n\nConstructs and returns a `ScreenLineIterator`, described below.\n\n### `buildTokenIterator ()`\n\nConstructs and returns a `TokenIterator`, described below.\n\n### `getLastScreenRow ()`\n\nReturns the last screen row in the index.\n\n### `getScreenLineCount ()`\n\nReturns the number of screen lines in the index.\n\n### `lineLengthForScreenRow (screenRow)`\n\nReturns the length of the line at the given screen row.\n\n### `getScreenPositionWithMaxLineLength ()`\n\nReturns a `{row, column}` object with the `row` containing the longest screen line and the `column` pointing to the length of that line.\n\n### `getScreenLines ()`\n\nReturns an array of all screen lines spliced into the index. Useful for debugging.\n\n## ScreenLineIterator\n\nThis object represents a pointer to a screen line in the display index. Its position is no longer valid after `splice` is called on the index, and you'll need to use a seek method on the iterator after modifying the index to restore it to a valid location.\n\n### `seekToScreenRow(screenRow)`\n\nSeeks the iterator to the given screen row (an integer).\n\n### `seekToBufferPosition(bufferPosition)`\n\nSeeks the iterator to the line containing the given `{row, column}` buffer position. If soft wraps are present, multiple screen lines may contain the same buffer position. You can use `isSoftWrappedAtStart` and `isSoftWrappedAtEnd` to disambiguate.\n\n### `moveToSuccessor()`\n\nMove to the next screen line. Returns a boolean indicating whether there was a next line to move to. If there isn't a next line, stays on the last line.\n\n### `moveToPredecessor()`\n\nMove to the previous screen line. Returns a boolean indicating whether there was a previous line to move to. If there isn't a previous line, stays on the first line.\n\n### `getScreenRow()`\n\nReturns the current screen row (an integer).\n\n### `getScreenLineLength()`\n\nReturns the length of the current screen line as an integer.\n\n### `getBufferStart()`\n\nReturns the `{row, column}` position of the start of the current screen line.\n\n### `getBufferEnd()`\n\nReturns the `{row, column}` position of the end of the current screen line.\n\n### `getTokens()`\n\nReturns an array of tokens on the current line.\n\n### `getId()`\n\nReturns the unique integer id of the current line.\n\n### `isSoftWrappedAtStart()`\n\nReturns a boolean indicating whether the line continues from a soft-wrapped line. You must supply this information yourself during `splice` via the `softWrappedAtStart` property.\n\n### `isSoftWrappedAtEnd()`\n\nReturns a boolean indicating whether the line is soft wrapped (ends in a soft line break). You must supply this information yourself during `splice` via the `softWrappedAtEnd` property.\n\n## TokenIterator\n\nThe token iterator is more fine-grained than the line iterator, allowing you to seek and iterate through individual tokens on screen lines.\n\n### `seekToScreenPosition(screenPosition)`\n\nSeeks the iterator to the rightmost token starting at or ending after the given `{row, column}` position on screen. If no token contains the given position, the nearest token is selected instead.\n\n### `seekToBufferPosition(bufferPosition)`\n\nSeeks the iterator to the rightmost token starting at or ending after the given `{row, column}` position in the buffer. If no token contains the given position, the nearest token is selected instead.\n\n### `moveToSuccessor()`\n\nMoves to the next token, returning a boolean to indicate whether a next token exists. This operation will move the iterator to the first token of the next line if it reaches the end of a line. If no next token exists, the iterator stays on the last token.\n\n### `moveToPredecessor()`\n\nMoves to the previous token, returning a boolean to indicate whether a previous token exists. This operation will move the iterator to the last token of the previous line if it reaches the start of a line. If no previous token exists, the iterator stays on the first token.\n\n### `getScreenStart()`\n\nReturns the `{row, column}` position of the start of the current token on screen.\n\n### `getScreenEnd()`\n\nReturns the `{row, column}` position of the end of the current token on screen.\n\n### `getScreenExtent()`\n\nReturns an integer indicating the length of the current token on screen.\n\n### `getBufferStart()`\n\nReturns the `{row, column}` position of the start of the current token in the buffer.\n\n### `getBufferEnd()`\n\nReturns the `{row, column}` position of the end of the current token in the buffer.\n\n### `getBufferExtent()`\n\nReturns the `{row, column}` extent of the current token in the buffer.\n\n### `getMetadata()`\n\nReturns the value supplied as the `metadata` field when populating the display index via `splice`.\n\n### `translateBufferPosition()`\n\nReturns the `{row, column}` screen position corresponding to the given `{row, column}` buffer position relative to the start of the token in the buffer. If the given position precedes the start of the token in the buffer, an exception is thrown. If the translated position would fall after the end of the token on screen, it is clipped to the end of the token.\n\n### `translateScreenPosition()`\n\nReturns the `{row, column}` buffer position corresponding to the given `{row, column}` screen position relative to the start of the token on screen. If the given position precedes the start of the token in on screen, an exception is thrown. If the translated position would fall after the end of the token in the buffer, it is clipped to the end of the token.\n\n[text-buffer]: https://github.com/atom/text-buffer\n","maintainers":[{"name":"atom","email":"nathan@github.com"},{"name":"nathansobo","email":"nathan@github.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-04-11T16:59:29.870Z","created":"2016-03-17T23:14:31.615Z","0.1.0":"2016-03-17T23:14:31.615Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/atom/display-index","keywords":["atom display index data-structure"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/atom/display-index.git"},"author":{"name":"Nathan Sobo","email":"nathan@github.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/nathansobo/display-index/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"570bd7f1-2db0\"","_lastModified":"Mon, 11 Apr 2016 16:59:29 GMT"}

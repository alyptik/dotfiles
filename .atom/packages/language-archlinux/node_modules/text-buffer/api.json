This is used to represent cursors, folds, snippet\ntargets, misspelled words, and anything else that needs to track a logical\nlocation in the buffer over time.\n\n### DisplayMarker Creation\n\nUse {DisplayMarkerLayer::markBufferRange} or {DisplayMarkerLayer::markScreenRange}\nrather than creating Markers directly.\n\n### Head and Tail\n\nMarkers always have a *head* and sometimes have a *tail*. If you think of a\nmarker as an editor selection, the tail is the part that's stationary and the\nhead is the part that moves when the mouse is moved. A marker without a tail\nalways reports an empty range at the head position. A marker with a head position\ngreater than the tail is in a \"normal\" orientation. If the head precedes the\ntail the marker is in a \"reversed\" orientation.\n\n### Validity\n\nMarkers are considered *valid* when they are first created. Depending on the\ninvalidation strategy you choose, certain changes to the buffer can cause a\nmarker to become invalid, for example if the text surrounding the marker is\ndeleted. The strategies, in order of descending fragility:\n\n* __never__: The marker is never marked as invalid. This is a good choice for\n  markers representing selections in an editor.\n* __surround__: The marker is invalidated by changes that completely surround it.\n* __overlap__: The marker is invalidated by changes that surround the\n  start or end of the marker. This is the default.\n* __inside__: The marker is invalidated by changes that extend into the\n  inside of the marker. Changes that end at the marker's start or\n  start at the marker's end do not invalidate the marker.\n* __touch__: The marker is invalidated by a change that touches the marked\n  region in any way, including changes that end at the marker's\n  start or start at the marker's end. This is the most fragile strategy.\n\nSee {TextBuffer::markRange} for usage. "

.SH NAME
grepmidi \- display structure of MIDI files
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgrepmidi\fR [ \fI-f\fR ] \fIfile\fR [ \fI...\fR ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBgrepmidi\fR utility provides a simple parser for files in raw MIDI
format.  It is far from complete, but allows to get a grip of the basic
song structure in \fIfile\fR.  That is, it does not display single note,
but only meta information embedded in the MIDI file.  \fBgrepmidi\fR can
also be useful to check whether a given MIDI file contains errors.
.PP
More than one \fIfile\fR can be given on the commandline.  Option \fB-f\fR
tells \fBgrepmidi\fR to prepend each line of output with the filename that
is currently checked.
.PP
\fBgrepmidi\fR is distributed along with \fBMusE\fR, a full-fledged MIDI
Music Editor.

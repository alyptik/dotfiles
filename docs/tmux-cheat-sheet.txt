				KEY BINDINGS

	tmux may be controlled from an attached client by using a key
	combination of a prefix key, ‘C-b’ (Ctrl-b) by default, followed
	by a command key.

     The default command key bindings are:

           C-b         Send the prefix key (C-b) through to the application.
           C-o         Rotate the panes in the current window forwards.
           C-z         Suspend the tmux client.
           !           Break the current pane out of the window.
           "           Split the current pane into two, top and bottom.
           #           List all paste buffers.

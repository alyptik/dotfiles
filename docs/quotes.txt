In the early days of Linux, we made a point to not port applications to Linux;
we ported Linux to applications. When X wouldn't build without sockets, we
didn't hack X to run without sockets, we added sockets to Linux, and so on.
Looks like the universe have come full.circle, and now BSD needs to catch up
with Linux if it wants to remain at all relevant. Of course, there is no hope
for Hurd. Hurd doesn't follow, it stampedes.

What's the term for the feeling you get when looking at code and wondering "who in the hell wrote this crap, it's all messed up, needs to be fixed, how is it even working in the first place!", so you run 'git blame' and realize it was yourself, over a decade ago?

Then, wondering if you can blame someone else for not fixing it up since then, you run 'scripts/get_maintainer.pl' and realize that you are the maintainer for it as well.

/*
 * NaCl Simple/secure ELF loader (NaCl SEL).
 *
 * This loader can only process NaCl object files as produced using
 * the NaCl toolchain.  Other ELF files will be rejected.
 *
 * The primary function, NaClAppLoadFile, parses an ELF file,
 * allocates memory, loads the relocatable image from the ELF file
 * into memory, and performs relocation.  NaClAppRun runs the
 * resultant program.
 *
 * This loader is written in C so that it can be used by C-only as
 * well as C++ applications.  Other languages should also be able to
 * use their foreign-function interfaces to invoke C code.
 *
 * This loader must be part of the NaCl TCB, since it directly handles
 * externally supplied input (the ELF file).  Any security
 * vulnerabilities in handling the ELF image, e.g., buffer or integer
 * overflows, can put the application at risk.

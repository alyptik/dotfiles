Hi, Joey --

Good question.

I honestly don't know the answer; C is entirely Dennis Ritchie's
invention and sadly we can't ask him now.  My best guess is that
"char" was originally signed or unsigned implicitly, depending on
what the hardware supported (e.g., signed for PDP-11), and when
unsigned types were added explicitly in the mid-1970s, that converted
one indeterminate type into three, two of which were explicit.

Some of this can be teased out of Dennis's HOPL paper, which is
here:
  www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/chist.html
There are other sources in that directory that you might find
interesting as well.  I also wonder whether the Rationale section
of the C standard has something to say about this, but I am far away
from my copy at the moment.

I hope you find out more; good luck.

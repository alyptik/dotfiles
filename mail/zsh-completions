Although subtrees have their uses, in my opinion, uses them would result in
nearly the same issues as we are currently having.

Git subtrees lend themselves better when developing both main project
and sub-project within the same directory (a "system approach"). This, however,
would be more akin to a "vendor branch": a branch which allows you to access
a well-defined version of a vendor external component or VCS subdirectory, and
which is only updated with the new version of every release of that external
component. I often hear this referred to as a "component-approach", where the
*all* system is viewed as a collection of separate components developed on
their own.

In this case, we have a project and a sub-project with their own respective
lifecycles; neither of which are developed at the same rhythm, tagged together
at the same time, nor even tagged with the same name.

I feel like a good compromise would be for there to be a seperate, isolated
`zsh-completions` repository that both projects can submodule; this would
slightly relieve the pressures of trying to keep development rhythms in
sync, and will, in my opinion, make it simpler, not to mention much less
painful, to share changes between the two projects.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBlist\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
Lists on standard output information from a single certificate file or signed
elf object. The selected field appears on a single line. If the field specified
does not apply to the named file, the command terminates with no standard
output. This output of this subcommand is intended for use in scripts and by
other commands.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBrequest\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
Generates a private key and a PKCS#10 certificate request. The PKCS#10
certificate request for use with the Solaris Cryptographic Framework. If the
private key is to be created in a token device, elfsign prompts for the PIN
required to update the token device. The PKCS#10 certificate request should be
sent to the email address \fIsolaris-crypto-req@sun.com\fR to obtain a
Certificate.
.sp
Users of \fBelfsign\fR must first generate a certificate request and obtain a
certificate before signing binaries for use with the Solaris Cryptographic
Framework.

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Generates a signed \fBELF\fR Sign Activation (\fB\&.esa\fR) file. This option
is used when a cryptographic provider has nonretail export approval for
unrestricted use and desires retail approval by restricting which export
sensitive callers (for example, IPsec) can use the provider. This option
assumes that the provider binary has previously been signed with a restricted
certificate.

Obsolete.

Formats other than \fBrsa_md5_sha1\fR include an informational timestamp with
the signature indicating when the signature was applied. This timestamp is not
cryptographically secure, nor is it used as part of verification.

.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the location of the private key file when not using a PKCS#11 token.
This file is an RSA Private key file in a Solaris specific format. When used
with the \fBrequest\fR subcommand, this is the ouput file for the newly
generated key.

.RS 4n
Specifies the file which holds the PIN for accessing the token device. If the
PIN is not provided in a \fIpin_file\fR, \fBelfsign\fR prompts for the PIN.

The government of the United States of America restricts the export of
"open cryptographic interfaces", also known as "crypto-with-a-hole".
Due to this restriction, all providers for the Solaris cryptographic
framework must be signed, regardless of the country of origin.

The terms "retail" and "non-retail" refer to export classifications for
products manufactured in the USA. These terms define the portion of the
world where the product may be shipped.) Roughly speaking, "retail" is
worldwide (minus certain excluded nations) and "non-retail" is domestic
only (plus some highly favored nations).
If your provider is subject to USA export control, then you
must obtain an export approval (classification)
from the government of the USA before exporting your provider.
It is critical that you specify the obtained (or expected, when
used during development) classification to the following questions
so that your provider will be appropriately signed.

Do you have retail export approval for use without restrictions
based on the caller (for example, IPsec)? [Yes/No] \fBNo\fR

If you have non-retail export approval for unrestricted use of your
provider by callers, are you also planning to receive retail
approval by restricting which export sensitive callers
(for example, IPsec) may use your provider? [Yes/No] \fBNo\fR

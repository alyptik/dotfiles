.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Nikola is a static website and blog generator. The very short
explanation is that it takes some texts you wrote, and uses them to
create a folder full of HTML files. If you upload that folder to a
server, you will have a rather full\-featured website, done with little
effort.
.sp
Its original goal is to create blogs, but it supports most kind of
sites, and can be used as a CMS, as long as what you present to the
user is your own content instead of something the user generates.
.sp
Nikola can do:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
A blog
.IP \(bu 2
Your company\(aqs site
.IP \(bu 2
Your personal site
.IP \(bu 2
A software project\(aqs site
.IP \(bu 2
A book\(aqs site
.UNINDENT
.sp
Since Nikola\-based sites don\(aqt run any code on the server, there is no
way to process user input in forms.
.sp
Nikola can\(aqt do:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Twitter
.IP \(bu 2
Facebook
.IP \(bu 2
An Issue tracker
.IP \(bu 2
Anything with forms, really (except for comments!)
.UNINDENT
.sp
Keep in mind that "static" doesn\(aqt mean \fBboring\fP\&. You can have
animations, slides or whatever fancy CSS/HTML5 thingie you like. It
only means all that HTML is generated already before being uploaded.
On the other hand, Nikola sites will tend to be content\-heavy. What
Nikola is good at is at putting what you write out there.
